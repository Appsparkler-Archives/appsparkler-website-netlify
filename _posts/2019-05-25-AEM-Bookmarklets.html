<h3>AEM Bookmarklets</h3>

<p>TLDR; AEM Dev Tools</p>

<h5>SWITCHING BETWEEN EDITOR-MODE and WCMMODE-DISABLED mode</h5>

<p>
  There were so many time during my AEM development workflow that I had to switch between WCMMODE-DISABLED and EDITOR-MODE.  The way I was doing it unitl now was to manually remove <code class="bg-dark text-white d-inline">/editor.html</code> and prepend <code class="bg-dark text-white d-inline">?wcmmode=disabled</code>.  Well, bookmarklets have come to the rescue.  With a click of a button; I can quickly switch between WCMMODE and EDITOR-MODE.  Thanks to <a href="https://www.bookmarkify.it" target="_blank" class="text-info">Bookmarkify.it</a>; I can share these bookmarks too.
